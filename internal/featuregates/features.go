package featuregates

/* Design aspects of implementing feature gates

- feature gate is only for experimental features
- Keep the feature gate as simple boolean.
- Any config specific for a feature gate should be in itâ€™s own configMap. This aligns with our current implementation of peer-pods and image generator feature
- When we decide to make the feature as a stable feature, it should move to kataConfig.spec
